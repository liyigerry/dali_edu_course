# Linux Basics

## What is Linux?

Linux /ˈlɪnəks/ is a family of free and open-source software operating systems built around the Linux kernel. Typically, Linux is packaged in a form known as a Linux distribution (or distro for short) for both desktop and server use. The defining component of a Linux distribution is the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.

## Linus Benedict Torvalds

Linus Benedict Torvalds, born December 28, 1969, is a Finnish–American software engineer who is the creator, and historically, the principal developer of the Linux kernel, which became the kernel for operating systems such as the Linux operating systems, Android, and Chrome OS. He also created the distributed revision control system Git and the diving logging and planning software Subsurface.

## The mind behind Linux

Linus Torvalds transformed technology twice -- first with the Linux kernel, which helps power the Internet, and again with Git, the source code management system used by developers worldwide.
